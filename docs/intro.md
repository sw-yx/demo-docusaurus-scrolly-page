# This is test content

## External links

These links behave like normal:

- [new.docusaurus.io](https://new.docusaurus.io)

## Internal links

- [/docs/tutorial-basics/create-a-page](/docs/tutorial-basics/create-a-page)
- [./tutorial-basics/create-a-page.md](./tutorial-basics/create-a-page.md)
  - this actually reads `. /tutorial-basics/create-a-page . md` but is transformed
- [/create-a-page](/create-a-page)
