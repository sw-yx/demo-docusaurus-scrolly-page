# This is test content

## External links

These links behave like normal:

- [new.docusaurus.io](https://new.docusaurus.io)

## Internal links

These links are equivalent:

- [/docs/tutorial-basics/create-a-page](/docs/tutorial-basics/create-a-page)
- [./tutorial-basics/create-a-page.md](./tutorial-basics/create-a-page.md)
  - this actually uses a relative link `. /tutorial-basics/create-a-page . md` but is transformed to be the same as the above
- [Create a Page](/tutorial-basics/create-a-page)
